/// A trait representing the resolution of a symbol in a file.
///
/// This trait is yielded as a trait object to the closure given to the
/// `backtrace::resolve` function, and it is virtually dispatched as it's
/// unknown which implementation is behind it.
///
/// A symbol can give contextual information about a funciton, for example the
/// name, filename, line number, precise address, etc. Not all information is
/// always available in a symbol, however, so all methods return an `Option`.
pub trait Symbol {
    /// Returns the name of this function as a byte array (may not always be
    /// valid UTF-8).

    /// Returns the starting address of this function.
    fn addr(&self) -> Option<*mut c_void> { None }

    /// Returns the file name where this function was defined.
    ///
    /// This is currently only available when libbacktrace is being used (e.g.
    /// unix platforms other than OSX) and when a binary is compiled with
    /// debuginfo. If neither of these conditions is met then this will likely
    /// return `None`.
    fn filename(&self) -> Option<&[u8]> { None }

    /// Returns the line number for where this symbol is currently executing.
    ///
    /// This return value is typically `Some` if `filename` returns `Some`, and
    /// is consequently subject to similar caveats.
    fn lineno(&self) -> Option<u32> { None }
}

/// Resolve an address to a symbol, passing the symbol to the specified
/// closure.
///
/// This function will look up the given address in areas such as the local
/// symbol table, dynamic symbol table, or DWARF debug info (depending on the
/// activated implementation) to find symbols to yield.
///
/// The closure may not be called if resolution could not be performed, and it
/// also may be called more than once in the case of inlined functions.
///
/// Symbols yielded represent the execution at the specified `addr`, returning
/// file/line pairs for that addres (if available).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// extern crate backtrace;
///
/// fn main() {
///     backtrace::trace(&mut |frame| {
///         let ip = frame.ip();
///
///         backtrace::resolve(ip, &mut |symbol| {
///             // ...
///         });
///
///         false // only look at the top frame
///     });
/// }
